##### State
An implementation of clock with alarm mode. The clock has three buttons. 'H' increases time in an hour, 'M' increases time in a minute and 'Mode' button that switches the clock to alarm settigns and back. In alarm settings mode the time buttons change alarm time. A long click on 'Mode' turns on an alarm mode and next long click turns it off. If the current time corresponds the alarm time and the alarm mode was enabled a bell mode is turned on. Bell mode can be turned off either by clicking on 'Mode' button or after a minute.
